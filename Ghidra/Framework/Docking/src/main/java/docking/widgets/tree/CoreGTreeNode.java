/**
 * This class exists to help prevent threading errors in {@link GTreeNode} and subclasses,
 * by privately maintaining synchronous access to the parent and children of a node. 
 * <P>
 * This implementation uses a {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList} to store its children. The theory is
 * that this will allow direct thread-safe access to the children without having to worry about
 * {@link ConcurrentModificationException}s.  Also, the assumption is that accessing the children 
 * will occur much more frequently than modifying the children.  This should only be a problem if
 * a direct descendent of AbstractGTreeNode creates it children by calling
 * addNode many times. But in that case, the tree should be using Lazy or 
 * SlowLoading nodes which always load into another list first and all the children will be set 
 * on a node in a single operation.
 * <P>
 * Subclasses that need access to the children
 * can call the {@link #children()} method which will ensure that the children are
 * loaded (not null). Since this class uses a {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList}, subclasses that call
 * the {@link #children()} method can safely operate and iterate on the list they get back without
 * having to worry about getting a {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.  
 * <P>
 * This class uses synchronization to assure that the parent/children relationship is stable across
 * threads.  To avoid deadlocks, the sychronization strategy is that if you have the lock on
 * a parent node, you can safely acquire the lock on any of its descendants, put never its 
 * ancestors.  To facilitate this strategy, the {@link #getParent()} is not synchronized, but it
 * is made volatile to assure the current value is always used.
